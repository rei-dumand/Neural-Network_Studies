If you are confused by how PyTorch delivers data, just print one batch to understand the data's shape:
"""
# for data in trainset:
    # print(data)           # we have [tensor(*list of* list of images), tensor(list of labels)]
    # print(len(data[0]))   # 10 items because batch_size = 10
    # print(data[0].shape)  # note that the images' tensor's shape is:
    #                           # 10 (items or images) of 
    #                           #  1 (wraps the list... why...) of
    #                           # 28 (px/row) by
    #                           # 28 (px/column)
    # print(len(data[1]))   # also 10 items because for 10 images you should have 10 labels
    # print(data[1])        # the labels' tensor is just a list of 10 items

    ## Note that every batch is different each new run because the data is shuffled on-load.

What if I want to make sure my data matches my label? Matplotlib üòè

Finally if I want to see if my dataset is balanced:
"""
# # first we count all instances of each possible label
# total = 0   # keeps a count of the total number of data points (images) in our dataset

#         counter_dict[int(label)] += 1   # lookup in our dictionary for the label value, and increment it.
#         total += 1
# # and then I just need to print out the occurence rate of each label value
